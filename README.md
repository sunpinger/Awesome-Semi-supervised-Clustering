**What is semi-supervised cluster learning？**

 Semi-supervised cluster learning is a new machine learning method that combines semi-supervised learning and cluster learning. In traditional unsupervised clustering learning, the data is usually unlabeled data, but in fact, not all data are unlabeled, but traditional methods cannot use these labeled data to improve the clustering effect. The data objects of semi-supervised clustering learning include both unlabeled data and labeled data. Using these data, semi-supervised clustering methods can effectively improve clustering performance.
